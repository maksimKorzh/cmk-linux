# A note on HOME folder
When you setup everything like custom fonts, terminal settings,<br>
alsa init etc. you can then grab your HOME directory from the USB<br>
flash drive and store it somewhaere. Later if you want to update your<br>
system just copy your HOME directory to USB after burning ISO to it and
you'll have all your settings on boot.
